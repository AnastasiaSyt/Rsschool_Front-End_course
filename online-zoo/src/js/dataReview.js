We decided to purchase the combo tickets which allows access both to the Zoo itself an stage Tropical Aquarium. Tickets were not cheap €40 each for one adult. We began our visit by going into the Tropical Aquarium first and I have to say this was the best part of the overall experience. I\'ve never seen seen such hugh aquariums before it was amazing. The Zoo or tierpark itself was OK but I found that some of the enclosures were rather small for some of the bigger animals ,e.g. Elephants. So a bit disappointed with that in have to say. I guess you have to remember that the City of Hamburg has encroached upon the park over many years which limits development, hence a 4 and not a 5. If I were to visit again I would certainty go to the Tropical Aquarium that was impressive, but the Zoo no.',
