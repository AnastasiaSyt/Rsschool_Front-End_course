### Async Race
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows you to efficiently manage a collection of cars, control their engines, and display comprehensive race statistics. To fully utilize this application, it is necessary to integrate the JSON-server, which can be found in this repository: https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api.
- Code - https://github.com/AnastasiaSyt/Rsschool_Front-End_course/tree/Async_Race
- Deploy - https://anastasiasyt-asyncrace.netlify.app
(Please ensure that the JSON-server is running, as the application will not function properly without it.)
